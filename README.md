# Summary
I developed and implemented a complete ETL process (it's my first independent project). I scraped the website  http://www.korter.ge to retrieve the relevant data. After parsing, it's transformed using Pandas and stored in a Google Spreadsheet. The Python script used for the ETL process is hosted on AWS and version-controlled on GitHub for easy updates. The script is running daily through a bash script and scheduled using crontab.

To complete this project, I utilized several technologies and libraries, including:

## Python libraries:
* Selenium for website scraping
* BeautifulSoup for data parsing
* Pandas for data transformation
* Gspread and gspread_dataframe for working with Google Spreadsheet API

## Cloud services:
* AWS for hosting the Python script
* Google Spreadsheet for storing the processed data

## Tools:
* Tableau for visualization
* GitHub for version control of the Python script
* Bash script for downloading the script from GitHub
* Crontab for scheduling the scripts run

# Personal
It was a challenging task as I am new in this field; however, I liked to work on the different technologies and connect various tools to make a meaningful, valuable result.
